# Properties Files Protection Rule

## Critical Protection Requirements

- **NEVER** modify, edit, create, or delete any `.properties` files without EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
- **ALWAYS** provide a FULL EXPLANATION before any changes:
  1. What exactly will be changed (show before/after)
  2. Why the change is necessary
  3. What impact the change will have on the system
  4. What risks might be involved
- **WAIT** for explicit user approval before proceeding with any changes
- **ASK FIRST** even for seemingly minor changes like formatting or comments

## Protected Files

- `config/team_members.properties` - Team member configuration
- `config/jira_api_whitelist.properties` - Security whitelist for API endpoints
- Any other `.properties` files in the config directory

## Required Permission Process

When ANY properties file change is needed:

1. **Current State**: Show existing configuration
2. **Proposed Changes**: Exact modifications to be made
3. **Justification**: Business reason for the change
4. **Impact Analysis**: How this affects application behavior
5. **Security Implications**: Any security considerations
6. **Rollback Plan**: How to undo the change if needed

## Example Request Format

```
üîí PROPERTIES FILE CHANGE REQUEST

File: config/jira_api_whitelist.properties
Action: Add new endpoint

CURRENT STATE:
[show current relevant section]

PROPOSED CHANGES:
[show exact changes to be made]

JUSTIFICATION:

IMPACT ANALYSIS:

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:

ROLLBACK PLAN:

**Remember**: These rules exist to protect critical system configuration and maintain security. When in doubt, always ask for permission first.
